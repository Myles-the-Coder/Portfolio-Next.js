				Gatherr is a progressive web application built with React that allows users view information on upcoming developer event, courtesy of the
				Google Calendar API. Gatherr uses Serverless and AWS Lambda functions to authenticate users with their Google accounts. From there, users can
				view all the events provided by the API, search for events in specific cities, and limit the query results to a number between one and
				thirty-two. Users can visualize the data quickly with a pie chart and line graph provided from the Recharts library.
			</p>
			<h2>Process & Context</h2>
			<p className='w-90'>
				Gatherr is a personal project built as part of CareerFoundry&#39;s Full-Stack Immersion Web Developer course. This project demanded a solid
				understanding of test-driven development (TDD) and using a serverless backend with Amazon Web Services (AWS).
			</p>
			<h2>Objective</h2>
			<p>
				Build a progressive web application that achieves the following: authenticate users using serverless AWS functions, follow the principles of
				test-driven development, allow users to download the application on their mobile device, give users the ability to use the app offline, and
				provide a way to visualize the API data.
			</p>
			<br />
			<h2>Solutions: </h2>
			<ol>
				<li>
					First, receive a consumer token from the Google Calendar API. Then, using <b>AWS Lambda</b> and <b>Serverless</b>, refresh the access token
					to authenticate users with their Google account.
				</li>
				<li>
					Using <b>Enzyme</b>, <b>Jest</b>, <b>Cucumber</b>, and <b>Puppeteer</b>, perform testing on individual components and cross-component
					integration to limit bugs during production. This also ensures elements such as buttons function properly.
				</li>
				<li>
					Use <b>React&#39;s </b> &quot;<code>manifest.json</code>&quot; file to make the application installable on the user&#39;s device.
				</li>
				<li>Use a service worker to serve cached content to the user when they have no internet connection.</li>
				<li>
					Use the <b>Recharts</b> library to display visualize event data by means of a pie chart and line graph.
				</li>

				The development of Gatherr was a difficult, but rewarding experience that gave me a better understanding of test-driven development and
				working with a FaaS like AWS Lambda. As many large companies and small startups can attest to, building an maintaining servers can be
				time-consuming endeavors. That is why, more so now then ever, serverless providers like AWS are becoming a popular choice for building
				serverless applications like Gatherr. Additionally, developing this project with a test-driven approach proved to be a good experience. After
				writing and completing the testing phase, I certainly appreciate the bug-preventing and time-saving benefits TDD offers.
			</p>
			<h2>Overcoming Challenges</h2>
			<p>
				The development process brought with it some challenges. When using AWS Lambda and Serverless, the biggest challenge was I faced initially was
				ensuring that my functions worked properly the Google Calendar API. It would seem that each time I made a request to get an authentication
				token, some issue would arise that prevented that token from generating. Because of the fact that the syntax for generating such a token is
				very specific, it took me sometime to wrap my mind around how this process was meant to work. After some trial and error, I was able to solve
				this issue by exploring the AWS and Google Calendar API documentation to ensure my code was setup properly.
			</p>
			<p>
				The other challenge I faced during development was learning the syntax involved with writing tests. Unit tests, while being written in
				JavaScript, are just unique enough in a way that gives this form of development its own learning curve. In the end, this was simply a matter
				of studying the documentation of Jest, Cucumber, and Puppeteer to make sure that the tests were written properly and functioned as one would
				expect.
			</p>
			<h2>Duration</h2>
			<p>
				The development of Gatherr took about three weeks from start to finish. Most of the development time was spent on learning the ins and outs of
				test-driven development and using AWS Lambda functions.
