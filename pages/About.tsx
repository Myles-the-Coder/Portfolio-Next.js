					Hello, my name is Myles Jefferson. I am a self-taught developer with a passion for building elegant and user-friendly applications. Starting
					from humble beginnings, I spent time honing my skills in HTML, CSS/SCSS, TypeScript, React, NextJS, NodeJS servers, Redux, Git, API
					development, SQL, and noSQL. In my professional experience, I have spent over a year working on a variety of projects, from small web
					applications to large-scale enterprise systems. I have been able to collaborate with clients and team members to ensure that projects are
					completed on time, within budget, and to the highest standards of quality. Through this work, I have also become comfortable with Docker,
					Azure DevOps, Linux servers, agile development methodologies, test-driven development, and continuous integration/continuous deployment
					(CI/CD) practices.
				</p>

					In my free time, I enjoy exploring new technologies, experimenting with side projects, and participating in online communities. I believe
					that staying curious and constantly learning is key to being a successful developer. I am always open to new opportunities and
					collaborations, so if you are interested in working together or have any questions, feel free to reach out. Let us build something great
					together!
